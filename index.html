    <p>Responsive web design enhances both the user and developer experience.
      For users, It increases accessibility and makes sites easier to find.
      For developers, it simplifies content and code management while increasing focus on functionality.
    </p>
    <p>Sites gain greater accessibility by being responsive – scaling to any screen size while maintaining a rich, clean and clear content experience.
      When users can easily visit a site from any device, a user base will grow.
      If smaller screen customers can’t use the site easily, that site risks <a href="https://www.socpub.com/articles/the-5-mobile-marketing-mistakes-infographic-14849">losing 50% of users</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Recently, google began giving additional SEO recognition to mobile friendly sites.
      Neglecting responsive design presents the risk of losing customers in a measurable way.
      If a user can’t find the answer near the top of the first page of search results,
      chances of a them coming to your site <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2276184/no-1-position-in-google-gets-33-of-search-traffic-study">dramatically decrease</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Developers using responsive web design do not need to anticipate the myriad ways
      users access their browsers, or how they will in the future.
      If we approach the problem of different screen sizes holistically, we are released from
      the complicated task of maintaining different sets of code for each, from the smallest
      mobile or wearable screen, to the largest game console browser
      displayed on the living room television.
    </p>
    <p>When code is written to be responsive, the developer must prioritize the functionality of the site,
      creating a user experience that is quick and easy.
      This helps us avoid scope creep and bloat while focusing on user goals.
